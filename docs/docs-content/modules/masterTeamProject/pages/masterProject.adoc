= A Blockchain-based system for course submissions

== Who we are

We are Elias Anderlohr, Jonas Grill and Gina Weber. We are / were master students in business informatics at the University of Mannheim.
We chose "A Blockchain-based system for course submissions" by Prof. Dr. Markus Strohmaier (Chair of Data Science in the Economic and Social Sciences) and Dr. Stefano Balietti as our Master Team Project.
We started the project in fall semester 2022.
The project was first launched in spring semester 2023.

== What we did

The basic idea of Prof. Strohmaier was to teach blockchain by using a blockchain based learning system. Therefore, basic concepts such as block numbers and smart contracts are understood through using the system.
We implemented a frontend with Next.js and tailwindCSS. The faucet was implemented via a Node.js backend. All other logical operations are running directly on-chain.
The chain is running on six raspberry PiÂ´s in the University of Mannheim which are working via a proof of authority consensus algorithm.
Only for the submission of student ID and wallet addresses, an off-chain system such as ILIAS is used to comply to data privacy rules.
