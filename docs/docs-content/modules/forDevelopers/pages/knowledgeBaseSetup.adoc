= Knowledge Base Setup for Developers

== Smart Contracts

=== Prerequisites

1. Change directory to `smart-contracts`
2. Install packages using `npm i`

=== Deploy smart contracts to local chain

Deploy contracts to chain using truffle.

1. Compile contracts `truffle compile`
2. Deploy contracts `truffle deploy`

=== Smart Contract Usage

In total the project has two major smart contracts:

1. `ConfigStorage`: Stores all necessary config parameters for the system to properly operate
2. `FaucetStorage`: Functions that are necessary for operating the ethereum faucet

Further the project also has some smart contracts that are implicitly deployed on the chain via inheritance.

Three contract are used for this:

1. `BaseAdmin`: Admin related functions
2. `BaseAssignment`: Base functions that every assignment contract (from the students) needs
3. `BaseValidator`: Base functions that every assignment validator contract (from the instructor) needs

=== Base Contract usage

A base contract can be easily imported into any other smart contract by importing the .sol file and referencing the file.

Example:
----
import "../contracts/BaseAdmin.sol";

contract ConfigStorage is BaseAdmin {
    ...
}
----

In this example the `ConfigStorage` smart contract inherits any function that the `BaseAdmin` class owns.

=== Development of custom assignment validators

To develop custom assignment validators two parts a necessary.

==== Part 1 - Assignment interface:
First of all the instructor needs to write a smart contract which owns all the necessary functions to test the smart contract as `virtual` functions.
This file can then be inherited by the student and by the validator contract.

An example interface file is shown here:

image::interfaceExample.png[Assignment Interface]

As you can see, the functions have no content and use the `virtual` keyword.
Therefore, the students do not get help to solve the assignment but get a skeleton to implement the necessary functions/methods.

==== Part 2 - Assignment Validator contract:
Secondly, the instructor needs to create the necessary validation contract.
To ensure that each validation contract follows the same guidelines as the others, the validation smart contract needs to inherit the `BaseValidator` contract.
This base contract, offers an interface that every assignment validator contract needs.
An example usage of the smart contract can be seen in the https://github.com/Jonas-Grill/mtp-blockchain/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/example/ExampleAssignmentValidator.sol[ExampleAssignmentValidator].

=== Example

The `ExampleAssignment` contract is a mock assignment with some simple functions.
This contract is an example, just like the students would deploy to the blockchain.

The instructor needs to develop an interface contract which is in our case the `ExampleAssignmentInterface`.
As you may see, the functions are not implemented and marked as `virtual`.
But they allow the `ExampleAssignmentValidator` contract to call the necessary functions for every contract which inherits the `ExampleAssignmentInterface`.

Using the frontend it is possible to test the deployed `ExampleAssignment` by taking the address of the person who deployed the `ExampleAssignment` (should be the student address) and the address of the `ExampleAssignment` smart contract.
Using these two parameters and the address of the validation contract it is possible to test any implementation of the `ExampleAssignment` contract (as long as the functions are implemented).

== Frontend

=== Prerequisites

1. Change directory to `frontend`.
2. Install packages using npm `npm i`

=== Frontend & smart contracts

To properly use the frontend the corresponding smart contracts have to be deployed to the chain.
The documentation on how to deploy the smart contracts to the chain can be viewed xref:knowledgeBaseSetup.adoc#_deploy_smart_contracts_to_local_chain[here].

=== Starting the frontend
To start the frontend for development, run:

----
npm run dev
----

To start the frontend for production, run:

----
npm run build
----

== Faucet

=== Prerequisites

1. Change directory to `faucet`.
2. Install packages using `npm i`

=== Faucet & smart contracts

To properly use the frontend the corresponding smart contracts have to be deployed to the chain.
The documentation on how to deploy the smart contracts to the chain can be viewed xref:knowledgeBaseSetup.adoc#_deploy_smart_contracts_to_local_chain[here].

=== Sending eth to faucet contract

The faucet contract needs to have some ether to send to the students.
To do so, send some ether to the faucet contract address. Use metamask or any other option to send gas to the FaucetStorage contract address.

=== Starting express API

To start the express API use the following command:

----
npm run dev
----

=== API Usage

The API has one endpoint that can be used to send ether to a student.
The endpoint is `POST /sendEth` and requires the following body:

----
{
    "toAddress": "0x9f8fD6722f8f74c9942d0751374a542F5847BfD1"
}
----
