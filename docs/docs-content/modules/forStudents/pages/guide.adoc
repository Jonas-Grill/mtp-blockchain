= Step-by-Step guide to Knowledge Base

If you are reading this, you already found our GitHub repository.
Knowledge Base is based on that repository, but can also be found via this link: TODO

When you first enter Knowledge Base you see a screen like this:

So you have a Faucet, Assignment Overview, Coin Overview, Submit assignment and Connect to Metamask button.

== Step 1: Log in with your metamask wallet

To use Knowledge Base, you need to have a metamask Wallet and login with your wallet address in Knowledge Base.
To do so, please read the documentation xref:metamask.adoc[Metamask Setup], because this is a whole other process.
To log in on Knowledge Base, you need to press the Connect to Metamask button and type in your password. Then press the unlock button.
Now you should see your public address in the top right corner instead of the Connect to Metamask button.

== Step 2: ILIAS survey

Once you have created your Metamask wallet and got your public address, please take the survey in the course on ILIAS.
You have to enter your student ID (Matrikelnummer) and your public address, so that your achieved Knowledge can be traced back to you.
Keep in mind, that if you do not take the survey in time, the lecturer can´t see your Knowledge, and you are not qualified for the exam!

== Step 3: Get gas

Once you are logged in with your Metamask wallet, you can go to the faucet and get gas.
You need gas to make transactions on the blockchain as you might have already learned in the lecture.
So just type in your wallet address and press the Get gas button to - you guessed it - get gas.
You can only use the faucet multiple times but only every once in a while because it has a cool down to stop motivated students from limit testing the Raspberry Pi´s.

== Step 4: Assignments for the semester

In the Assignment Overview you see all the assignment tasks which you have to complete in the semester.
You won´t see a due date or time, but only starting block and end block for submission. One block is signed after 12 seconds.
So you need to find out the current block number and calculate your due date on your own.
The tasks itself are found on each assignment via a link that leads to a PDF document. There you can see the task descriptions and the maximum Knowledge you can earn.
With your calculated due date and the task you are ready to write some code.

== Step 5: Submitting your assignments

At Submit assignment, you can hand in your code. You need gas for those steps, so make sure, that you used the faucet before. For this you have to deploy your solution on the blockchain. Then you can see the contract address of your code.
In Knowledge Base, when you provide that contract address, in the background there is a smart contract or validator contract, that tests your code.
The validator contract consists of a number of tests. According to the number of tests passed you achieve your Knowledge from the validator contract directly to your personal wallet, which may take a second.

You can also test your code to see, how much Knowledge you would get for the current state of the code.
You can test as often as you want.

Only when you press the submit button, the contract will give out the Knowledge amount you got.
You can only submit once and can not undo a submission!

Be careful, you can only submit or test a contract address from the public address that deployed it.

You can see your Knowledge in your Metamask wallet or in the Coin Overview.
In the Coin Overview you also see how much Knowledge is needed to qualify for the exam and how much Knowledge you still need for the qualification.
